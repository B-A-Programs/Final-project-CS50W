# JobFinder - HarvardX CS50W: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript Final Project
***
## Technologies used
In creating this app I used [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for the backend (a python framework), while for the frontend I used [Html](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) and [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp), as well as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to more easily stylise each page.
## Distinctiveness and Complexity
JobFinder is an app which helps companies connect with qualified people looking for jobs in a wide range of fields.  
To achieve this the app uses multiple Django models, has many views each of which can behave differently depending on the request method and/or on any arguments included in the link and the pages use JavaScript to display different elements depending on what the user requests, as well as the device which he is currently using (the app is mobile responsive).
